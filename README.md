showing how much is wasted, where it happens, and how it changes over time. 
It tracks details like total wastage in pieces and kilograms, average bag weights, and types of bags affected. 
By breaking this information down by process and month, it helps identify problem areas and opportunities to reduce waste and improve efficiency
